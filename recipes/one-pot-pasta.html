    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Delicious, easy, and perfect for a quick dinner after a busy 
        work night, this one pot pasta just needs one skillet and some 
        basic ingredients. Plus, you get plenty of leftovers for a few 
        more days! This recipe should ideally make 4 servings, but in my
        experience following the original recipe, it has made 1 serving.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup pasta</li>
        <li>2 sausages</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cups good quality chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sundried tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/2 cup broccoli florets</li>
        <li>Pinch of red pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated parmesan</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Add the olive oil and sausages to the skillet, and cook over
            medium heat till the sausages brown. Then, slice into
            medallions. Add the medallions back to the skillet and brown
            on both sides. Transfer the cooked sausage pieces to a bowl.
            Drain off till you have 1 Tbsp of fat in the skillet.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add the minced garlic to the skillet and saute till slightly
            brown. Add the chicken broth and stir to dissolve the brown
            bits stuck to the bottom of the skillet.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add the pasta and sun dried tomatoes to the skillet. You can
            add a pinch of red pepper at this step if you'd like. Turn
            the heat up to medium high, stir, then close with a lid.
        </li>

        <li>
            Once the broth starts to boil, stir, replace the lid, and 
            turn the heat down to low so that the broth simmers. simmer
            for about 7 minutes, stirring every couple of minutes, or
            until the pasta is tender and most of the liquid is 
            absorbed. If the pasta is tender before the broth was
            absorbed, let it simmer for a few more minutes without the
            lid, till the liquid is thick.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add the cooked sausage and broccoli back to the pasta, and
            stir to combine. Transfer to a bowl, sprinkle the Parmesean
            on top, and serve immediately.
        </li>
    </ol>
