    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Nobody can say no to a sweet treat! but when you need to decide 
        between a soft and gooey brownie or a crumbly cookie, the 
        the choices may seem dire. So was the conundrum experienced by 
        the recipe's original author's coworker for her birthday treat. 
        The author decided to surprise her with an original recipe 
        combining the two instead! How sweet (pun intended)! This 
        recipe makes 20 brookies.
