# odin-recipes
A basic recipe website being built with HTML.

Meant to demonstrate the implementation of the following in HTML:

- Basic Boilerplate
- Headers and paragraphs
- Bold and italic text
- Lists
- Absolute and relative links (using Anchor elements)
- Images

### Reflection

It's incredibly satisfying to be able to develop something with my own two hands. Ideating and planning the layout of each recipe page was a lot of fun, but writing the content was time consuming, I would have to admit.

I find basic HTML very straightforward. It's very much akin to working with markup, just with more indentation (for clarity), and triangle brackets. Of course, exiting the scope of what this project aims to showcase would be more challenging to work with.

Working with Git was what I found the most challenging with this project. The commands for staging and committing are fairly easy, but following best practice with commit messages, and deciding when to commit, was tough for me. I wasn't able to completely follow through with the conventions I had set for all my commits, with a few commits in past tense rather than in imperative present. Keeping within the 50 character limit was also hard when commiting from the command line.

Overall, this was an easy and fun project so far, and it was a good way for me to start dipping my toes into HTML.
