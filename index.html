        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>
            Welcome to Odin Recipes! This is meant to be a basic recipe 
            website built with HTML as a project for The Odin Project 
            course. The website is meant to implement some basic features 
            of HTML as practice, which are outlined in the README.md for 
            this website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below you'll find two recipes for some of my favourite dishes. 
            The one pot pasta is a recipe I've attempted, failed to 
            properly make, and remembered as a key memory of my culinary 
            experiments. Click any link to see it's recipe!
